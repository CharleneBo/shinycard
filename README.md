# Welcome to shinycard

**Just a silly project with a shinycard in it!**

## What did I use

* React + Vite 🏃🏻‍♀️
* Node.js
* Javascript
* Blood and tears

## How to run it 

First, do a `npm install` to install all the node requirements.

Then, just throw a `npm run dev` in the terminal and go tp http://localhost:5173/ to check out the cards !
